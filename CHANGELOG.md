# Changelog

## 2.16.0 — 2026-07-06

### Added — `cmp-design-bridge` 0.3.0: the `design-intake` skill (screenshot → Compose)
- **`skills/design-intake/SKILL.md`** (new) — implement a Compose screen from an
  arbitrary raster (Figma export, competitor screenshot, photo of a mock): declare
  content-box + theme-translation (judgment inputs), sequence the CLI's `intake`
  (normalize/provenance/palette/grid/optional-OCR evidence; requires
  cmp-design-bridge CLI ≥0.2.0), author the translate-to-the-design-system
  Compose (component > token > flagged raw; ROLE-based cross-theme color mapping),
  loop via `verify --reference imported` until the grade converges, then backfill
  the design frame from the shipped source + gate with `lint --fail-on-backfill`.
  Deliberately NOT a generator: no auto chrome detection, no pixel-diff gate.

## 2.15.0 — 2026-07-06

### Added — `cmp-quality` architecture migration recipes (harness-contract instances)
- **`references/architecture-migration-recipes.md`** (new) — five proven,
  project-agnostic architecture/state-lifecycle recipes, each written against the
  `migration-harness` plugin's recipe contract (agent-marketplace): visibility-
  `internal` sweep, dead-code/dead-edge removal, transport→domain-error boundary
  translation, threaded-param removal sweep, and flow start-mode sweep (stateIn
  Eagerly→WhileSubscribed — incl. the cross-step pre-fill escalation site, the
  Turbine sequence-test pre-collect fix, and the false-passing-test coverage trap,
  all observed in the validating run). Each recipe states its target invariant,
  discovery mechanics, **classification table** (mechanical vs batch-escalate sites),
  transform shape (foundation-inline vs fan-out), **per-site verify declarations**
  (mechanical — never transform-agent self-attestation), completion gate (pointing at
  the `cmp-arch-gates` deterministic gates), and known failure modes observed in real
  executions.
- **`references/compose-recomposition-migration-recipes.md`** — new section "Running
  these under the migration-harness" retrofits the two missing contract slots
  (classification/escalation table incl. the emission-order equivalence trap;
  per-site verify declarations) onto the existing deferred-reads and stability-config
  recipes.
- **`PROVENANCE.md`** updated for the new authored-original reference.

Plugin versions: `cmp-quality` 2.11.0 → 2.12.0. Marketplace 2.14.0 → 2.15.0.

## 2.14.0 — 2026-07-05

### Changed — `cmp-scaffold` compose-performance reference: strong-skipping calculus (generic)
- **`references/compose-performance.md`** rewritten to the **same** strong-skipping
  story the `cmp-quality` `performance-audit` agent and
  `compose-recomposition-migration-recipes.md` now tell (shipped 2.13.0). The scaffold
  reference had drifted to **pre-strong-skipping folklore** and actively contradicted the
  audit side. Fixed:
  - **`@Immutable` / `@Stable` reframed as load-bearing, not a last resort.** The old
    "When You Still Need Stability Annotations / annotations are a last resort" framing is
    gone. New "Stability Annotations Are Load-Bearing" section: a `combine`-built (or
    otherwise per-emission-rebuilt) UiState is a **new-but-equal** instance every emission,
    so `===` fails and only `.equals()`-comparison — which the annotation enables — skips
    the subtree. This is the common case.
  - **combine section corrected.** Reference caching preserves the **fields** of
    non-emitting upstreams, but the transform lambda **builds a new wrapper every
    emission**; passing that wrapper down (the idiomatic shape) needs `@Immutable` for
    `.equals()`-skipping. The old diagram implied "no annotation needed in most cases."
  - **`ImmutableList` de-blanketed.** Was Option 3 "strongest guarantee for
    performance-critical lists"; now explicitly **not a blanket migration** — a
    cache-stable `List` skips fine by `===`; use immutable collections only for genuine
    uncacheable identity churn.
  - **Added:** the generic-type-argument rule (a container is stable iff its type
    arguments are — register the arguments, never a `<*>` mask); lambdas are auto-memoized;
    the compiler report as the evidence source (`metricsDestination` / `reportsDestination`
    + the `--rerun-tasks` regeneration gotcha).
  - **Strong-skipping default corrected** Kotlin 2.0 → **2.0.20**; cross-references the
    `cmp-quality` `performance-audit` finding bar + `compose-recomposition-migration-recipes.md`.
  Structure/voice preserved; the unchanged sections (AnimatedContent contentKey,
  Performance Budgets, lazy-list keys, image loading, ViewModel init) are verbatim.
  Generic throughout — no project names.

### Changed
- Plugin versions: `cmp-scaffold` 2.10.0 → 2.11.0. Marketplace 2.13.0 → 2.14.0.

## 2.13.0 — 2026-07-05

### Changed — `cmp-quality` performance-audit: strong-skipping calculus (generic)
- **`performance-audit`** agent rewritten around the **strong-skipping stability
  calculus** (Kotlin ≥ 2.0.20), replacing the pre-2.0.20 folklore its Checks 1–3
  carried. The agent now: (1) **grounds every stability finding in the Compose
  compiler report** — a new evidence step wires `metricsDestination` /
  `reportsDestination` and documents the empirically-verified regeneration gotcha
  (the metrics options don't invalidate up-to-date compile tasks — `--rerun-tasks`
  is required); (2) enforces a **three-part finding bar** (report-unstable param +
  fresh per-recomposition allocation at the call site + hot/wide subtree — all three
  required); (3) treats **`@Immutable` as load-bearing, not redundant** — it upgrades
  comparison from `===` to `.equals()`, which is what per-emission-rebuilt
  (combine-built) UiState needs to skip; (4) adds the **generic-type-argument rule**
  (a container is stable iff its type arguments are — register the arguments, never a
  `<*>` mask); and (5) ships a **folklore kill-list** the agent must NOT report
  ("unnecessary `@Immutable` under strong skipping", "`remember {}`-wrapped lambdas
  unnecessary", blanket `List` → `ImmutableList` migrations). The old Check 1/3 INFO/WARN
  items that flagged `@Immutable`/`@Stable` for removal are gone.

### Added — `cmp-quality` recomposition migration recipes (generic)
- **`references/compose-recomposition-migration-recipes.md`** (new) — two
  project-agnostic, behavior-preserving remediation recipes, each gated on screenshot
  **zero-drift**: **(1) deferred-reads migration** (site-discovery greps → move an
  animated read from the composition phase into draw/layout via
  `drawWithCache`/`onDrawBehind`, `graphicsLayer`, or the lambda `offset {}` variant;
  the `@Composable`-getter trap for theme tokens; KDoc-must-match-code); and **(2)
  stability-config reconciliation** (regenerate reports → diff report-unstable domain
  types vs the config → register/annotate → regenerate to prove the flips → guard with
  a config-FQN existence gate, cross-referencing the `cmp-arch-gates` linter as the
  gate's home). The `performance-audit` agent now names the applicable recipe as the
  fix path in its report.
- **`plugins/cmp-quality/PROVENANCE.md`** (new) — declares the `references/` content
  authored-original (nothing vendored), satisfying `check-coupling.sh` check #5 now
  that cmp-quality has a `references/` dir.

### Changed
- Plugin versions: `cmp-quality` 2.10.0 → 2.11.0. Marketplace 2.12.0 → 2.13.0.
- Upstreamed from the streakbank-cmp presentation-integrity audit (2026-07); the
  project-specific facts (registered types, config path, screenshot invocation,
  in-repo reference composables) stay in the consuming project's shim per the
  core/shim discipline.

## 2.12.0 — 2026-07-03

### Added — `cmp-arch-gates` plugin (new)
- **`cmp-arch-gates`** — a thin skill wrapping the new `cmp-arch-gates` CLI (npm):
  deterministic architecture gates for KMP / Compose Multiplatform — a
  layered-module-DAG + boundary/visibility linter for CI or local runs. Five gates
  (`module-direction`, `implementation-only-modules`, `data-api-purity`,
  `datasource-visibility`, `cross-owner-dataapi`), each a pure `run(root, config)`
  module in the CLI; all project facts live in the consuming repo's
  `.arch-gates/config.json` (transport modules, cross-owner allowlist, banned
  imports, doc pointer) — the plugin and CLI hardcode none. Ships `SHIM-TEMPLATE.md`
  for the consumer's path-keyed `.claude/rules/` pointer, and the CLI's
  `init --detect` scaffolds + reports candidate facts for a new repo (never
  auto-allowlisting existing edges). Extracted from the streakbank-cmp Wave-0
  architecture-CI bash suite and generalized behind the config seam; validated
  bash-parity green on the origin repo. `check-coupling.sh` passes.

### Fixed — coupling admission gate
- **`scripts/check-coupling.sh`** — the project-name grep is now case-INSENSITIVE
  (`grep -IniE`), so a mixed-case brand name in prose (`StreakBank`, `LadderPicks`) is
  caught, not just the lowercase spelling. Attribution/schema URLs are exempted by
  blanking only the URL TOKEN (any `scheme://` URL + bare `github.com` /
  `raw.githubusercontent.com` hosts, case-folded) before the grep — so a plugin's own
  repo/schema URL may name the org while coupling PROSE sharing that line is still
  caught, and a capitalized `GitHub.com` attribution URL no longer spuriously fails.
  (The same case-sensitivity gap exists in agent-marketplace's copy — a separate
  follow-up.)

## 2.11.0 — 2026-07-03

### Fixed — client-error pattern (generic correctness)
- **`cmp-scaffold`** — generated ViewModels/Screens now emit a one-shot `Channel<UiMessage>(BUFFERED).receiveAsFlow()` message stream + a `userMessageFor(throwable, default)` mapper seam, replacing `errorEvents: MutableSharedFlow<String>` (which replays on config change and mixes success/error/empty strings) and raw `throwable.message` piped to the UI (which leaks technical text / URLs). A neutral Material `SnackbarHost` remains the default host — projects can swap it. New `UiMessage` type + `userMessageFor` seam documented in `code-templates.md`; updates threaded through `data-patterns.md`, `analytics-patterns.md`, `deep-linking-patterns.md`, `test-patterns.md`, and the `scaffold-feature`/`add-screen`/`scaffold-tests`/`add-analytics`/`polish-ui` skills.
- **`cmp-quality`** — `audit-architecture` Check 7, `review-changes`, `validate-module`, `validate-tests` now enforce that generic contract (one-shot typed message stream + `userMessageFor`; no raw `throwable.message`) instead of hard-requiring `MutableSharedFlow<String>` + a *Material* host. The message host is now project-defined — a custom host satisfies the check.

### Fixed — cmp-quality internal contradictions
- **`validate-module`** §2.5 — DI check accepts `InMemory*`, `Room*`, or `Ktor*` as the `*LocalDataSource` binding (was hard-coded to `InMemory*`, false-failing modules migrated via `add-room-database`/`add-ktor-networking`).
- **`validate-module`** / **`dependency-audit`** — the `feature → data:api` direction is now domain-layer-aware and stated once: when a `domain` module exists the feature depends on `domain` (per `add-domain-layer`) and the direct `data:api` edge is optional; `dependency-audit` Check 8 supersedes Check 1 in that case. Resolves the Check 1↔8 contradiction and the `:core:feature` severity mismatch.
- **`validate-module`** Phase 4 — defers cross-module dependency/registration checks to `dependency-audit` (single source of truth) instead of duplicating them, mirroring `audit-architecture`.

### Fixed — cmp-design-bridge decoupling + staleness
- Removed project-coupling leaks from the (generic) skill bodies: `design-transform` no longer names StreakBank/Roborazzi/`recordRoborazziDebug`/`compose-canvas-dp.md` (now neutral `<project screenshot tool>` / `<gate-record command>` placeholders); `design-push` no longer names the retired `streakbank-ux` repo or a project memory file.
- Removed the dead `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/*.mjs` fallback + in-plugin `npm link` from `design-pull`/`design-fidelity`/`design-transform` (the CLI is the published `cmp-design-bridge` npm package); install is now just `npm i -g cmp-design-bridge`.
- Added a `design-transform` ↔ `polish-ui` visual-authority boundary note (don't run both on one screen; `design-transform` owns screens with an authoritative design frame).

### Added — mechanized discipline (governance)
- **`scripts/check-coupling.sh`** — the coupling/manifest admission gate (ported + adapted from agent-marketplace): scans `skills/` **and** `agents/` for project-name / absolute-path / named-rule leaks, with carve-outs for the org name in repo-address lines + `author`/`owner` JSON and for the `cmp-design-bridge` npm install address. Shellcheck-clean.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — CI admission gate: coupling check + shellcheck + JSON-manifest validation on every push/PR.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — the generic-core-only contribution discipline for this marketplace's three plugins.
- **`plugins/cmp-scaffold/PROVENANCE.md`** — declares the `references/` content authored-original (nothing vendored), satisfying the gate's provenance check honestly.

### Changed
- Plugin versions: `cmp-scaffold` 2.9.0 → 2.10.0, `cmp-quality` 2.9.0 → 2.10.0, `cmp-design-bridge` 0.1.0 → 0.2.0. Marketplace 2.10.0 → 2.11.0.

## 2.10.0 — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`cmp-design-bridge`** plugin (v0.1.0) — thin skills wrapping the published `cmp-design-bridge` npm CLI: `design-pull`, `design-transform`, `design-fidelity` (steady-state Claude Design → Compose loop) + the gated `design-push` (one-time port INTO Claude Design). (This entry backfills the marketplace 2.10.0 bump, which shipped the plugin at commit `1a4d907` without a CHANGELOG line.)

## 2.9.0 — 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **`performance-audit`** — downgraded Check 1 (`@Stable`/`@Immutable` on data classes) from WARN to INFO (unnecessary but not harmful with strong skipping)
- **`accessibility-audit`** — clarified Check 6 (testTag) is for test automation, not screen reader accessibility
- **`validate-tests`** — downgraded mock framework usage from FAIL to WARN (MockK is acceptable for cross-platform)

- **`ui-recipes-cards.md`** — added inline comment explaining `Color.White` image overlay exception
- **`add-navigation-tab`** — updated description from "bottom navigation" to cover adaptive layouts (bottom bar, rail, drawer)
- **`compose-performance.md`** — fixed reduce motion reference to point directly to `ui-recipes-surfaces.md` instead of `ui-recipes.md`
- **6 skills** gained verification checklists: `add-screen`, `add-navigation-tab`, `add-remote-datasource`, `add-ktor-networking`, `add-image-loading`, `add-domain-layer`
- **All version numbers** aligned to 2.9.0 across `marketplace.json`, both `plugin.json` files, and CHANGELOG

## 2.8.0 — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **5 new skills:** `add-permissions` (runtime permission handling), `add-deep-linking` (URI schemes + App Links), `add-analytics` (Firebase Analytics + Crashlytics), `add-background-sync` (WorkManager + BGTaskScheduler), `add-push-notifications` (FCM + APNs)

- **`adaptive-layouts-patterns.md`** — clarified alpha-stable status (alpha by semver, stable for production within CMP 1.10+)
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — added Skill Dependency Diagram showing intended workflow order and chaining; documented argument-hint convention (app-level skills omit it)
- **All version numbers** aligned to 2.8.0 across `marketplace.json`, both `plugin.json` files, and CHANGELOG

## 2.7.0 — 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **P0: `theming-patterns.md`** — added image overlay scrim exception clause to the "no hardcoded colors" rule
- **P1: `ui-recipes-forms.md`** — replaced hardcoded English strings (`"Hide password"`, `"Name is required"`, `"Invalid email"`) with `stringResource()` / `getString()` calls

- **`compose-performance.md`** — clarified screen transition budget (≤ 300ms) and relationship to `AnimDuration.long`
- **`scaffold-feature`** — inlined project context detection (was referencing deleted `project-context.md`)
- **`scaffold-tests`** — moved `test-patterns.md` to shared `references/` directory; updated all reference paths

### Fixed
- **`extract-strings`** — added `Write` to `allowed-tools` (was unable to create `strings.xml` for modules that don't have one)

### Removed
- **`architecture-rules.md`** — deleted 135-line documentation-only file never referenced by any agent or skill (agents inline their own criteria)
- **`project-context.md`** — deleted 37-line file redundant with inline context detection in every skill

## 2.4.0 — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **2 new skills:** `add-theming` (Material 3 theming with color scheme, typography, dark mode toggle, DataStore persistence) and `add-adaptive-layout` (adaptive NavigationSuiteScaffold with WindowSizeClass detection)

- **1 new agent:** `validate-tests` — audits test quality, structure, and patterns (test doubles, Turbine usage, dispatcher setup, error path coverage)

### Changed
- **`polish-ui`** — now uses `context: fork` for isolated execution (scan-heavy, matches other fork skills)
- **`audit-architecture`** — removed partial accessibility check (Check 13); directs users to the dedicated `accessibility-audit` agent for comprehensive coverage
- **`validate-module`** — added networking (K1–K3) and persistence (P1–P3) pattern checks to Phase 2 data layer validation
- **`scaffold-feature`** — report now suggests `add-screen`, `add-remote-datasource`, `scaffold-tests`, and `polish-ui` as next steps
- **`add-remote-datasource`** — report now suggests `add-ktor-networking`, `scaffold-tests`, and `polish-ui` as next steps

- **`plugin.json`** — both plugins bumped from stale 2.0.0 to current version

## 2.2.0 — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **`design-tokens.md`** — new `AnimEasing` token catalog (standard, decelerate, accelerate, spring) with usage guidance
- **`ui-recipes.md`** — 4 new sections: Reduce Motion Support (expect/actual `rememberReduceMotion()` + conditional animation), Connectivity Indicator (`ConnectivityBanner` composable), Bottom Sheet & Dialog Patterns (ModalBottomSheet + ConfirmationDialog recipes), Gesture Convention Reference (platform gesture table)
- **`theming-patterns.md`** — Dark Mode Best Practices (tonal surfaces, no pure black, edge-to-edge) and Color Accessibility (WCAG AA minimums, semantic color pairs, Material Theme Builder reference)
- **`compose-performance.md`** — Performance Budgets section (cold launch, transitions, scroll, touch response targets) with lazy list `key` pattern and ViewModel init guidance
- **`adaptive-layouts-patterns.md`** — Orientation & State Preservation (rememberSaveable, scroll position, content width constraint)
- **`data-patterns.md`** — Offline UX Guidance in cache-first pattern (isRefreshing, lastRefreshed, connectivity-aware state)
- **`accessibility-audit.md`** — Check 13 (reduce motion compliance) and Check 14 (color contrast indicators)

- **`review-changes.md`** — 3 new Composable/UI checklist items (reduce motion, hardcoded colors, lazy list keys)

### Changed
- **`polish-ui`** — added Step 15 (reduce motion) and Step 16 (connectivity awareness); verify checklist now checks reduce motion fallback and named easing

- **`add-screen`** — Step 5 now includes `key` parameter note for lazy lists
- **`design-tokens.md`** — rule paragraph updated to flag raw easing as violation; import block includes `AnimEasing`
- **`ui-recipes.md`** — anti-patterns table expanded with `LinearEasing` and missing reduce motion entries; Key Rules updated with `AnimEasing.*`

## 2.1.1 — 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- **`polish-ui`** — skill now produces visible UI changes instead of only mechanical plumbing. Rewrites item composables with card recipe patterns, adds staggered list entry animations, adds scale-on-press micro-interactions, enforces 3+ typography styles per item, and applies ContentAlpha to secondary/tertiary text. Step 2 now globs all `.kt` files under the feature module to find item composables in `views/` subdirectories.
- **`ui-recipes.md`** — added explicit `import androidx.compose.material3.pulltorefresh.PullToRefreshBox` to Pull-to-Refresh recipe (was causing compile failure with wrong import path). Added Minimum Visual Upgrade Checklist section. Added `contentKey = { it::class }` to AnimatedContent recipe to prevent data-change flicker.

### Added
- **1 new reference file:** `compose-performance.md` — strong skipping mode, reference stability in ViewModel `combine` chains, stability annotation options, and `AnimatedContent` `contentKey` rule
- **`architecture-rules.md`** — new Performance section with rule PERF-1 (AnimatedContent contentKey)
- **`audit-architecture.md`** — Check 15: flags `AnimatedContent` without `contentKey` when used with sealed UiState
- **`review-changes.md`** — added `contentKey` check to Composable/UI checklist

## 2.1.0 — 2026-02-08

### Added
- **1 new skill:** `polish-ui` — enhances a feature's UI with shimmer loading, rich cards, animated state transitions, and visual hierarchy while preserving architecture (ViewModel/Repository/DI/Navigation untouched). Includes a design assessment step inspired by Anthropic's frontend-design plugin, adapted for Material 3 mobile constraints.
- **1 new reference file:** `ui-recipes.md` — opinionated, copy-paste-ready Compose Multiplatform component recipes covering shimmer loading, empty/error states, card compositions, list animations, state transitions, detail screens, search, surface patterns, and micro-interactions. Includes a Design Philosophy preamble with anti-pattern guidance.
- **`AnimDuration` design tokens** in `design-tokens.md` — `short` (150ms), `medium` (300ms), `long` (500ms) for consistent animation timing across all recipes

### Changed
- **`scaffold-feature`** — report step now suggests `polish-ui` as a follow-up for visual polish
- **`design-tokens.md`** — added `AnimDuration` token catalog, import, and rule coverage for raw animation duration literals

## 2.0.0 — 2026-02-08

### Added
- **5 new skills:** `add-ktor-networking` (Ktor 3.x HTTP client), `add-room-database` (Room KMP persistence), `add-image-loading` (Coil 3 image loading), `add-convention-plugins` (build-logic included build), `upgrade-dependencies` (version catalog updates)
- **1 new agent:** `accessibility-audit` — audits composables for contentDescription, touch targets, heading semantics, testTag coverage, role semantics, and live regions
- **5 new reference files:** `networking-patterns.md` (Ktor 3.x), `persistence-patterns.md` (Room KMP), `theming-patterns.md` (Material 3), `image-loading-patterns.md` (Coil 3), `convention-plugins-patterns.md` (build-logic)

### Changed
- **`data-patterns.md`** — added Pattern 3 (Room persistence) and Pattern 4 (Ktor networking) with upgrade path diagrams
- **`code-templates.md`** — added `@Preview` section with commonMain unified annotation; added CMP 1.10+ deprecation note for `compose.xxx` shorthand accessors
- **`design-tokens.md`** — fixed `<package>` → `{package_base}` placeholder consistency; added TouchTarget section documenting 48dp minimum
- **`architecture-rules.md`** — added accessibility rules (A1–A5), image loading rules (I1–I3), networking rules (K1–K3), persistence rules (P1–P3)
- **`audit-architecture.md`** — added Check 13 (accessibility basics) and Check 14 (image loading)
- **`review-changes.md`** — added accessibility checks to composable/UI checklist; added networking/persistence checks to data layer checklist; updated implementation naming to include `Room*`

## 1.1.0 — 2026-02-08

### Changed
- **Agents now self-contained** — inlined all PASS/FAIL/WARN check criteria directly in agent system prompts instead of referencing external files. Agents no longer waste turns loading context.
- **Merged quality references** — combined `architecture-rules.md` and `audit-checklist.md` into a single `architecture-rules.md` (single source of truth)
- **Deleted scaffold `architecture-rules.md`** — skills use `code-templates.md` for patterns; quality owns rule enforcement
- **Simplified `marketplace.json`** — stripped to spec-compliant fields only (removed `$schema`, `keywords`, `category`, `license`, `repository`, `homepage`)
- **Removed redundant `skills`/`agents` paths from `plugin.json`** — Claude Code auto-discovers from default directories
- **Added `context: fork`** to `fix-imports` and `extract-strings` skills (scan-heavy, benefits from context isolation)
- **Wired `design-tokens.md`** into `scaffold-feature` and `add-screen` skills (was orphaned)
- **Inlined brief context detection** in skills instead of depending on `project-context.md` as execution reference
- **Trimmed report templates** across all skills — concise instructions instead of rigid markdown templates
- **Fixed `data-patterns.md`** — replaced skill invocation link with code-templates.md reference

## 1.0.0 — 2026-02-08

### Added
- Reference files for progressive disclosure: `project-context.md`, `code-templates.md`, `design-tokens.md`, `data-patterns.md`, `string-resources.md` (cmp-scaffold), `architecture-rules.md` (cmp-quality), `test-patterns.md` (scaffold-tests)
- `argument-hint` frontmatter to all skills that accept arguments
- README.md, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md

### Changed
- Slimmed all 7 SKILL.md files by extracting duplicated content into shared reference files
- Slimmed all 4 agent .md files by extracting check definitions into shared reference files
- Architecture rules consolidated from inline content across 11 skill/agent files
